### Description
A Laravel + Livewire application that allows users to browse and search through a list of Star Wars actors. Users can view detailed movie appearances for each actor in a sleek modal interface.

### ✨ Features
- 🔍 Dynamic Search: Filter actors instantly by name using a responsive search input.
- 🎬 Movie Modal: Click “Show Movies” to open a modal with a list of Star Wars movies associated with the actor.
- 📦 Livewire Integration: UI updates are reactive and powered by Livewire without full-page reloads.
- 💅 Tailwind CSS Styling: Responsive and elegant design with utility-first styling.

### 📸 Screenshots

#### 🖼️ Actor Modal Open
Displays the modal for Adam Driver, listing his Star Wars movie appearances. The modal is styled cleanly and appears centered over the dark space-themed background.

#### 🖼️ Search in Action
Demonstrates the live search functionality. As the user types "Adam", the actor list filters to show only matching results.

#### 🖼️ Character Browser Screen
Highlights the “Browse Characters” feature. The user can search for characters (not actors) dynamically. When the user types a name (e.g., “Adam”), the interface filters results in real-time.

### 🌐 API Integration
This project leverages the public SWAPI ([swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev)) — the Star Wars API — to fetch data about characters in real time. It uses Laravel's HTTP client to interact with the API and displays results within the UI without page reloads, thanks to Livewire.
